# What is this?

If you'd like for your server to be displayed in the server browser then you need to install this Plugin with the new 0.9.0 version of [XLMultiplayer](https://github.com/silentbaws/XLMultiplayer). This will allow you to access the [SXLservers.com](https://sxlservers.com) API which is linked up with the server browser.

# Installation

Simply unzip and drop the folder inside the Plugins directory of your server. That's it!

# What does it send?

Just simple server information and IP. **If you are hosting a server locally, this will expose your external IP address, which is kind of obvious. It's recommended you only host Public servers on Remote servers!**
